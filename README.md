# Instructions on Assignment
You are given a data set consisting of DNA sequences (the file is available here) of the same length. Each DNA sequence is a sequence of characters from the alphabet ‘A’,’C’,’T’,’G’, and it represents a particular viral strain sampled from an infected individual. Your goal is to write a code that helps to identify so-called transmission clusters that correspond to ongoing viral outbreaks.
